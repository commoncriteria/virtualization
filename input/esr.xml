		This Essential Security Requirements (ESR) document specifies the essential requirements 
		for client virtualization software.  The creation of an ESR is a necessary prerequisite 
		for the recognition of the Client Virtualization Protection Profile as a PP.
	</section>

	<section title="Background and Purpose" id="purpose">
		<!-- This section sets the context for not only the ESR, but what is 
			expected of the resulting Protection Profile (PP). The intent is 
			that the remaining sections provide succinct statements that 
			highlight the relevant aspects to be addressed by the Technical 
			Community (TC) constructing the PP. Here, the authors provide a 
			narrative that introduces the reader to the problem being solved, 
			and presents key aspects that support or guide the TC, and may
			elaborate on subtleties not apparent in the “bulleted” high level
			statements.
		-->
		Client Virtualization, for the purposes of this PP, refers to a virtualization system (VS) that implements 
		virtualized hardware components locally on an endpoint machine.  Endpoints are typically client hardware 
		such as desktop or laptop computers that a user interacts with directly, but may also include headless embedded
		systems without direct human interaction. It creates a virtualized hardware 
		environment for each instance of a guest operating system (virtual machines or VMs) permitting these 
		environments to execute concurrently while maintaining the appearance of isolation and exclusive control 
		over assigned computing resources. Client virtualization is generally used on endpoint systems, making use 
		of the local machine's resources (memory, CPU, etc.) to provide isolated user environments. This PP does not 
		address virtualization on mobile devices (typically devices that use a baseband processor and/or connect to a 
		cellular network). Nor does it address application virtualization or containers.<br></br>
		
		This document describes the high-level set of security requirements that client 
		virtualization software must satisfy when evaluated against the PP under development.

	<section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">
		<!-- 
			This section is intended to provide the initial scope/bound of the 
			security problem by providing the reader with concise statements 
			regarding the scenarios in which the technology is being used. The 
			intended usage presented here should lay the groundwork for the 
			identifying the resources to be protected, and what threats must be
			considered in the drafting of the Essential Security Requirements 
			(ESR) and for the TC to consider when writing the PP.

		<ul>
			<li>Locally Managed Client - A local administrator creates and runs one or more VMs locally.  
				This client could be stand-alone or connected to a network.
			</li>
			<li>Enterprise Managed Client - An enterprise administrator for the VS centrally manages one or 
				more client hypervisors, creating and configuring VMs which are then pushed to the clients.  These 
				VMs are then available for users on that client to run using the computing resources of that client. 
				(Note that this is not Virtual Desktop Infrastructure where the hypervisors and the VMs run on remote 
				servers.  While both can be centrally managed and accessed from clients, for client virtualization, 
				the VMs are local to the endpoint machine).
			</li>
			<li>Headless Client – A VM is used by a program without direct human interaction.

		<!--
        	This is where the authors present an initial set of English 
        	requirements that specify security functionality, rather than 
        	design and/or implementation characteristics. These requirements 
        	will provide the foundation for which the detailed set of 
        	requirements is derived. It is important that the requirements 
        	captured here make an attempt to fully address the categories 
        	(e.g., access control, identification and authentication, 
        	management capabilities, roles of administration, secure 
        	communications, and audit). That's not to say the requirements are 
        	fully specified or detailed enough to simply translate to Common 
        	Criteria security functional requirements. The goal is that there 
        	is enough information contained here, as well as the other sections
        	of this document, to provide the TC enough information to ensure 
        	they have an understanding of what is minimally required in breath.

		The following are the essential security requirements that are expected to 
		be implemented by any application that is compliant with the Client Virtualization 
		PP. Note that these security requirements are conditional on that functionality 
		being present. For example, a product that does not require an external network 
		connection for any purpose is considered to satisfy any security requirements that 
		pertain to the secure use of external network connections. 
		<br></br>
		Any other conditional requirements that depend on whether or not the product 
		implements a certain capability are listed in the “Optional Extensions” section below.
		<br></br>
		The Virtualization System shall:
		<ul>
			<li>Maintain isolation between its VMs (and their resources)
			</li>
			<li>Maintain the integrity of the VMM
			</li>
			<li>Protect the platform from VMs and remote users of the VS
			</li>
			<li>Protect the Management Subsystem (if applicable) from unauthorized access
			</li>
			<li>Be capable of being updated/patched in a secure and timely manner
			</li>
			<li>Provide the VMs access to sufficient sources of entropy (or necessary platform resources)
			</li>
			<li>Provide audit capabilities for security-relevant events
			</li>
		</ul>

	<section title="Assumptions" id="assumptions">
		<!--
			Simply put, this section presents the aspects of the product and 
			its	intended environment that can be assumed to hold true. This 
			will provide additional scope on the resulting PP.

		<ul>
			<li>The VS relies on a trustworthy computing platform for its execution, and it 
				is assumed that the platform has not been compromised prior to the installation of the VS.
