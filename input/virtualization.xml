    <chapter id="intro" title="Introduction">
        <section id="overview" title="Overview">
            The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to describe the security functionality of virtualization technologies in 
		terms of [CC] and to define security functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP is not complete 
		in itself, but rather provides a set of requirements that are common to the Extended Packages (EP) for Server
		Virtualization and for Client Virtualization. These capabilities have been broken out into this generic ‘base’ PP due
		to the high degree of similarity between the two product types.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
            Due to the increasing prevalence of virtualization technology in enterprise computing environments, it is essential to
		ensure that this technology is implemented securely in order to mitigate the risk introduced by sharing multiple
		computers and their data across a single physical system.

        <section id="complianttargets" title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation">
            A Virtualization System (VS) is a software product that enables multiple independent computing systems to execute on the 
		same physical hardware platform without interference from one other. A VS creates a virtualized hardware environment
		(virtual machines or VMs) for each instance of an operating system permitting these environments to execute 
		concurrently while maintaining isolation and the appearance of exclusive control over assigned computing resources.
		For the purposes of this document, the VS consists of a Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), Virtual Machine (VM) 
		abstractions, a management subsystem, and other components.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
            A VMM is a collection of software components responsible for enabling VMs to function as expected by the software
		executing within them. Generally, the VMM consists of a Hypervisor, Service VMs, and other components of the VS,
		such as virtual devices, binary translation systems, and physical device drivers. It manages concurrent execution of 
		all VMs and virtualizes platform resources as needed.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
            The Hypervisor is the software executive of the physical platform of a Virtualization System. A hypervisor operates at 
		the highest CPU privilege level and manages access to all of the physical resources of the hardware platform. It
		exports a well-defined, protected interface for access to the resources it manages. A Hypervisor’s primary function is 
		to mediate access to all CPU and memory resources, but it is also responsible for either the direct management or the
		delegation of the management of all other hardware devices on the hardware platform. This document does not specify
		any Hypervisor-specific requirements, though many VMM requirements would naturally apply to a Hypervisor.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
            A Service VM is a VM whose purpose is to support the Hypervisor in providing the resources or services necessary to
		support Guest VMs. Service VMs may implement some portion of Hypervisor functionality, but also may contain important
		system functionality that is not necessary for Hypervisor operation. As with any VM, Service VMs necessarily execute
		without full Hypervisor privileges—only the privileges required to perform its designed functionality. Examples of 
		Service VMs include device driver VMs that manage access to physical devices, and name-service VMs that help establish 
		communication paths between VMs.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
            A Guest VM is a VM that contains a virtual environment for the execution of an independent computing system. Virtual 
		environments execute mission workloads and implement customer-specific client or server functionality in Guest VMs, 
		such as a web server or desktop productivity applications. A Helper VM is a VM that performs services on behalf of
		one or more Guest VMs, but does not qualify as a Service VM—and therefore is not part of the VMM. Helper VMs implement
		functions or services that are particular to the workloads of Guest VMs. For example, a VM that provides a virus 
		scanning service for a Guest VM would be considered a Helper VM. The line between Helper and Service VMs can easily
		be blurred. For instance, a VM that implements a cryptographic function—such as an in-line encryption VM—could be 
		identified as either a Service or Helper VM depending on the particular virtualization solution. If the cryptographic
		functions are necessary only for the privacy of Guest VM data in support of the Guest’s mission applications, it would
		be proper to classify the encryption VM as a Helper. But if the encryption VM is necessary for the VMM to isolate
		Guest VMs, it would be proper to classify the encryption VM as a Service 
		VM. For the purposes of this document, Helper VMs are subject to all requirements
		that apply to Guest VMs, unless specifically stated otherwise.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
            <subsection id="toeboundary" title="TOE Boundary">
                Figure 1 shows a greatly simplified view of a generic Virtualization System and Platform. TOE components are displayed
		    in Red. Non-TOE components are in Blue. The Platform is the hardware, firmware, and software onto which the VS is 
		    installed. The VMM includes the Hypervisor, Service VMs, and VM containers, but not the software that runs inside
		    Guest VMs or Helper VMs. The Management Subsystem is part of the TOE, but may or may not be part of the VMM. 
		    <h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>

                <figure entity="images/figure1.png" title="Figure 1: Virtualization System and Platform " id="vsplatform"/>
    
                For purposes of this Protection Profile, the Virtualization System is the TOE, subject to some caveats. The Platform
		    onto which the VS is installed (which includes hardware, platform firmware, and Host Operating System) is not
		    part of the TOE. Software installed with the VS on the Host OS specifically to support the VS
		    or implement VS functionality is part of the TOE. General purpose software—such as device drivers for physical 
		    devices and the Host OS itself—is not part of the TOE, regardless of whether it supports VS functionality or 
		    runs inside a Service VM or control domain. Software that runs within Guest and Helper VMs is not part of the 
		    TOE.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                In general, for virtualization products that are installed onto “bare metal,” the entire set of installed components
		    constitute the TOE, and the hardware constitute the Platform. Also in general, for products that are hosted by or
		    integrated into a commodity operating system, the components installed expressly for implementing and supporting
		    virtualization are in the TOE, and the Platform comprises the hardware and Host OS.
            </subsection>
            <subsection id="platformreqs" title="Requirements Met by the Platform">
                Depending on the way the VS is installed, functions tested under this PP may be implemented by the TOE or by the
		    Platform. There is no difference in the testing required whether the function is implemented by the TOE or by the
		    Platform. In either case, the tests determine whether the function being tested provides a level of assurance 
		    acceptable to meet the goals of this Profile with respect to a particular product and platform. The equivalency 
		    guidelines are intended in part to address this TOE vs. Platform distinction, and to ensure that the assurance 
		    level does not change between instances of equivalent products on equivalent platforms—and also, of course, to
		    ensure that the appropriate testing is done when the distinction is significant.
            </subsection>
            <subsection id="scopecert" title="Scope of Certification">
                Successful evaluation of a Virtualization System against this profile does not constitute or imply successful 
		    evaluation of any Host Operating System or Platform—no matter how tightly integrated with the VS. The Platform,
		    including any Host OS, supports the VS through provision of services and resources. Specialized VS components 
		    installed on or in a Host OS to support the VS may be considered part of the TOE. But general-purpose OS
		    components and functions—whether or not they support the VS—are not part of the TOE, and thus
		    are not evaluated under this PP.
            </subsection>
            <subsection id="attestation" title="Vendor Attestation">
                This PP includes several SFRs that include elements that are met via vendor attestation. Attestation assurance 
		    activities are reserved for SFRs that define properties that are critical to the system’s security functionality,
		    but that are impossible or impractical to test in a repeatable and consistent manner. These Attestation assurance 
		    activities require the vendor to make an assertion in the ST that their product meets the 
		    specified SFR—no further testing or assessment of the product regarding these SFRs or elements is performed by the
		    CCTL. The CCTL will simply verify that the ST includes a pre-determined Attestation statement.
		    By including this statement in the ST, the vendor is accepting responsibility for the assurance
		    of their product in these particular areas. If at any time evidence is produced that indicates that these
		    statements are false (and the product does not meet the specified security functionality), the CC certificate may
		    be revoked. See FDP_VMS_EXT.1, FDP_VNC_EXT.1, FPT_VDP_EXT.1, and FPT_VIV_EXT.1 for the associated Attestation
		    statements.
            </subsection>
            <subsection id="equiv" title="Product and Platform Equivalence">
                The tests in this Protection Profile must be run on all product versions and Platforms with which the Vendor would 
		    like to claim compliance—subject to this Profile’s equivalency guidelines (see Annex E).

        <section id="usecases" title="Use Cases">

                    <description>VMs are the fundamental subject of the system. The VMM is 
                        responsible for applying the system security policy (SSP) to the VM and 
                        all resources. As basic functionality, the VMM must support a security policy that mandates 
                        no information transfer between VMs.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                        The VMM must support the necessary mechanisms to isolate the resources of all 
                        VMs. The VMM partitions a platform's physical resources for use by the 
                        supported virtual environments. Depending on the use case, a VM may require a completely 
                        isolated environment with exclusive access to system resources, or share some of its resources with other 
                        VMs. It must be possible to enforce a security policy that prohibits the transfer of data 
                        between VMs through shared devices. When the platform security policy allows the sharing of 
                        resources across VM boundaries, the VMM must ensure that all access to 
                        those resources is consistent with the policy. The VMM may delegate the responsibility for 
                        the mediation of sharing of particular resources to select Service VMs; however in doing so, 
                        it remains responsible for mediating access to the Service VMs, and each Service 
                        VM must mediate all access to any shared resource that has been delegated to it in 
                        accordance with the SSP.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                        Devices, whether virtual or physical, are resources requiring access control. The VMM must 
                        enforce access control in accordance to system security policy. Physical devices are platform devices with 
                        access mediated via the VMM per the O.VMM_Integrity objective. Virtual devices may include 
                        virtual storage devices and virtual network devices. Some of the access control restrictions must be enforced
                        internal to Service VMs, as may be the case for isolating virtual networks. 
                        VMMs may also expose purely virtual interfaces. These are VMM specific, 
                        and while they are not analogous to a physical device, they are also subject to access control.<h:br>

                        The VMM must support the mechanisms to isolate all resources associated with virtual 
                        networks and to limit a VM's access to only those virtual networks for which it has been 
                        configured. The VMM must also support the mechanisms to control the configurations of 
                        virtual networks according to the SSP.

                    <description>VMM management functions include VM> configuration, virtualized 
                        network configuration, allocation of physical resources, and reporting. Only certain authorized system users 
                        (administrators) are allowed to exercise management functions.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                        Because of the privileges exercised by the VMM management functions, it must not be possible 
                        for the VMM’s management components to be compromised without administrator notification. 
                        This means that unauthorized users cannot be permitted access to the management functions, and the management 
                        components must not be interfered with by Guest VMs or unprivileged users on other 
                        networks—including operational networks connected to the TOE.<h:br></h:br><h:br>
                        </h:br> VMMs include a set of management functions that collectively allow administrators 
                        to configure and manage the VMM, as well as configure Guest VMs. These 
                        management functions are specific to the virtualization system, distinct from any other management functions 
                        that might exist for the internal management of any given Guest VM. These 
                        VMM management functions are privileged, with the security of the entire system relying on 
                        their proper use. The VMM management functions can be classified into different categories 
                        and the policy for their use and the impact to security may vary accordingly.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                        The management functions might be distributed throughout the VMM (within the 
                        VMM and Service VMs). The VMM must support the necessary 
                        mechanisms to enable the control of all management functions according to the system security policy. When a 
                        management function is distributed among multiple Service VMs, the VMs 
                        must be protected using the security mechanisms of the Hypervisor and any Service VMs 
                        involved to ensure that the intent of the system security policy is not compromised. Additionally, since 
                        hypercalls permit Guest VMs to invoke the Hypervisor, and often allow the passing of data 
                        to the Hypervisor, it is important that the hypercall interface is well-guarded and that all parameters be 
                        validated.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br> The VMM maintains configuration data for every 
                        VM on the system. This configuration data, whether of Service or Guest VMs,
                        must be protected. The mechanisms used to establish, modify and verify configuration data are part of the VS 
                        management functions and must be protected as such. The proper internal configuration of Service 
                        VMs that provide critical security functions can also greatly impact VS security. These 
                        configurations must also be protected. Internal configuration of Guest VMs should not 
                        impact overall VS security. The overall goal is to ensure that the VMM, including the 
                        environments internal to Service VMs, is properly configured and that all Guest 
                        VM configurations are maintained consistent with the system security policy throughout 
                        their lifecycle.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br> Virtualization Systems are often managed remotely. For 
                        example, an administrator can remotely update virtualization software, start and shut down 
                        VMs, and manage virtualized network connections. If a console is required, it could be 
                        run on a separate machine or it could itself run in a VM. When performing remote management, 
                        an administrator must communicate with a privileged management agent over a network. Communications with the 
                        management infrastructure must be protected from Guest VMs and operational networks.

                                The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement schemes using the following 
				    Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement scheme verify that a TOE has
				    implemented the components of the key agreement scheme according to the specifications in the
				    Recommendation. These components include the calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret
				    value Z) and the calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function 
				    (KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the components of key
				    confirmation have been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes
				    the parsing of the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                <h:i>Function Test</h:i><h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The Function test verifies the ability of the to implement the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct 
				    this test, the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of 
				    the TOE supported schemes. For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF
				    type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester shall 
				    generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or 
				    the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both
				    depending on the scheme being tested.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static and/or ephemeral), the
				    MAC tag(s), and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and TOE id fields.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall obtain only the public keys 
				    and the hashed value of the shared secret.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given scheme by using a 
				    known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value, derive the keying material DKM,
				    and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                If key confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each implemented approved MAC 
				    algorithm.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                <h:i>Validity Test</h:i><h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid and invalid key 
				    agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator shall 
				    obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A key agreement
				    implementation to determine which errors the TOE should be able to recognize. The evaluator
				    generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors consisting of data sets including domain
				    parameter values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private
				    key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the other info and TOE id fields.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE recognizes
				    invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret
				    value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the data to be MACed, or the generated MACTag.
				    If the TOE contains the full or partial (only ECC) public key validation, the evaluator will also 
				    individually inject errors in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public
				    keys and the TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key 
				    validation function and/or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the
				    test vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results
				    (they should pass).<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme using the 
				    corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results with the results using 
				    a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects these errors.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>

Each test vector shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext.

                        <title>The TSF shall cause disused cryptographic keys in volatile memory to be destroyed or rendered 
				unrecoverable.
                        </title>
                        <note role="application">The threat addressed by this element is the recovery of disused cryptographic keys
				from volatile memory by unauthorized processes.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            The TSF is expected to destroy or cause to be destroyed all copies of cryptographic keys created and
				managed by the TOE once the keys are no longer needed. This requirement is the same for all instances
				of keys within TOE volatile memory regardless of whether the memory is controlled by TOE manufacturer 
				software or by 3rd party TOE modules. The assurance activities are designed with flexibility to
				address cases where the TOE manufacturer has limited insight into the behavior of 3rd party TOE 
				components.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            The preferred method for destroying keys in TOE volatile memory is by direct overwrite of the memory
				occupied by the keys. The values used for overwriting can be all zeros, all ones, or any other pattern
				or combination of values significantly different than the value of the key itself such that the keys
				are rendered inaccessible to running processes.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            Some implementations may find that direct overwriting of memory is not feasible or possible due to 
				programming language constraints. Many memory- and type-safe languages provide no mechanism for
				programmers to specify that a particular memory location be accessed or written. The value of such
				languages is that it is much harder for a programming error to result in a buffer or heap overflow.
				The downside is that multiple copies of keys might be scattered throughout language-runtime memory. 
				In such cases, the TOE should take whatever actions are feasible to cause the keys to become
				inaccessible—freeing memory, destroying objects, closing applications, programming using the minimum 
				possible scope for variables containing keys.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            Likewise, if keys reside in memory within the execution context of a third-party module, then the 
				TOE should take whatever feasible actions it can to cause the keys to be destroyed.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            Cryptographic keys in non-TOE volatile memory are not covered by this requirement. This expressly includes 
				keys created and used by Guest VMs. The Guest is responsible for disposing of such keys.</note>

                        <title>The TSF shall cause disused cryptographic keys in non-volatile storage to be destroyed or rendered 
				unrecoverable.
                        </title>
                        <note role="application">
                            The ultimate goal of this element is to ensure that disused cryptographic keys are inaccessible not only
				to components of the running system, but are also unrecoverable through forensic analysis of discarded
				storage media. The element is designed to reflect the fact that the latter may not be wholly practical
				at this time due to the way some storage technologies are implemented (e.g., wear-leveling of flash
				storage).<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            Key storage areas in non-volatile storage can be overwritten with any value that renders the keys 
				unrecoverable. The value used can be all zeros, all ones, or any other pattern or combination of
				values significantly different than the value of the key itself.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            The TSF is expected to destroy all copies of cryptographic keys created and managed by the TOE once the
				keys are no longer needed. Since this is a software-only TOE, the hardware controllers that manage
				non-volatile storage media are necessarily outside the TOE boundary. Thus, the TOE manufacturer is
				likely to have little control over—or insight into—the functioning of these storage devices. The 
				TOE is expected to make a “best-effort” to destroy disused cryptographic keys by invoking the 
				appropriate platform interfaces—recognizing that the specific actions taken by the platform are out of
				the TOE’s control.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            But in cases where the TOE has insight into the non-volatile storage technologies used by the platform, 
				or where the TOE can specify a preference or method for destroying keys, the destruction should be
				executed by a single, direct overwrite consisting of pseudo-random data or a new key, by a repeating 
				pattern of any static value, or by a block erase.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            For keys stored on encrypted media, it is sufficient for the media encryption keys to be destroyed for 
				all keys stored on the media to be considered destroyed.

                                Note: using debug or instrumented builds of the TOE and TOE components is permitted in order to

				    builds are based on the same source code as are release builds (of course, with instrumentation
				    and debug-specific code added).

                                The evaluators devise an input set consisting of m/8 messages,
                                where m is the block length of the hash algorithm. The length of the ith message
                                is 512 + 8*99*i, where 1 &#2264; i &#2264; m/8 <!--   1 = i = m/8-->.
                                The message text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluators compute the message
                                digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when
                                the messages are provided to the TSF.

                                This test is for byte-oriented implementations only. The evaluators randomly generate a
                                seed that is n bits long, where n is the length of the message digest produced by the
                                hash function to be tested. The evaluators then formulate a set of 100 messages and
                                associated digests by following the algorithm provided in Figure 1 of [SHAVS]. The
                                evaluators then ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are
                                provided to the TSF.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>

				    The tests below are derived from the The Secure Hash Algorithm-3 Validation System (SHA3VS), 
				    Updated: April 7, 2016, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.<h:br/><h:br/>
				    For each SHA-3-XXX implementation, XXX represents d, the digest length in bits. The capacity, c,
				    is equal to 2d bits. The rate is equal to 1600-c bits.  <h:br/><h:br/>
				    The TSF hashing functions can be implemented with one of two orientations. The first is a bit-oriented
			  	    mode that hashes messages of arbitrary length. The second is a byte-oriented mode that hashes messages 
				    that are an integral number of bytes in length (i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be
				    hashed is divisible by 8). Separate tests for each orientation are given below. <h:br/><h:br/>
				    The evaluator shall perform all of the following tests for each hash algorithm and orientation
				    implemented by the TSF and used to satisfy the requirements of this PP. The evaluator shall
				    compare digest values produced by a known-good SHA-3 implementation against those generated by
				    running the same values through the TSF.<h:br/><h:br/><h:br/><h:br/>
				    <h:b>Short Messages Test, Bit-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
				    The evaluators devise an input set consisting of rate+1 short messages. The length of the messages
				    ranges sequentially from 0 to rate bits. The message text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The
				    evaluators compute the message digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result
				    is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF. The message of length 0 is omitted if the
				    TOE does not support zero-length messages.<h:br/><h:br/><h:br/>
				    <h:b>Short Messages Test, Byte-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
				    The evaluators devise an input set consisting of rate/8+1 short messages. The length of the
				    messages ranges sequentially from 0 to rate/8 bytes, with each message being an integral number of 
				    bytes. The message text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluators compute the message
				    digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages
				    are provided to the TSF. The message of length 0 is omitted if the TOE does not support zero-length
				    messages.<h:br/><h:br/><h:br/>
				    <h:b>Selected Long Messages Test, Bit-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
				    The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 long messages ranging in size from 
				    rate+(rate+1) to rate+(100*(rate+1)), incrementing by rate+1. (For example, SHA-3-256 has a rate
				    of 1088 bits. Therefore, 100 messages will be generated with lengths 2177, 3266, …, 109988 bits.)
				    The message text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for
				    each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided
				    to the TSF.<h:br/><h:br/><h:br/>
				    <h:b>Selected Long Messages Test, Byte-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
				    The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 messages ranging in size from (rate+(rate+8))
				    to (rate+100*(rate+8)), incrementing by rate+8. (For example, SHA-3-256 has a rate of 1088 bits.
				    Therefore 100 messages will be generated of lengths 2184, 3280, 4376, …, 110688 bits.) The message
				    text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for each of the
				    messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF.<h:br/><h:br/><h:br/>
				    <h:b>Pseudo-randomly Generated Messages Monte Carlo) Test, Byte-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
				    The evaluators supply a seed of d bits (where d is the length of the message digest produced by
				    the hash function to be tested. This seed is used by a pseudorandom function to generate 100,000 
				    message digests. One hundred of the digests (every 1000th digest) are recorded as checkpoints. The
				    TOE then uses the same procedure to generate the same 100,000 message digests and 100 checkpoint
				    values. The evaluators then compare the results generated ensure that the correct result is
				    produced when the messages are generated by the TSF.<h:br/><h:br/>

                            This requirement ensures that sufficient entropy is available to any VM that requires it. The entropy 
				need not provide high-quality entropy for every possible method that a VM might acquire it. The VMM
				must, however, provide some means for VMs to get sufficient entropy. For example, the VMM can
				provide an interface that returns entropy to a Guest VM. Alternatively, the VMM could provide 
				pass-through access to entropy sources provided by the host platform.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            This requirement allows for three general ways of providing entropy to guests: 1) The VS can provide a 
				Hypercall accessible to VM-aware guests, 2) access to a virtualized device that provides entropy, or 
				3) pass-through access to a hardware entropy source (including a source of random numbers). In all 
				cases, it is possible that the guest is made VM-aware through installation of software or drivers.
				For the second and third cases, it is possible that the guest could be VM-unaware. There is no
				requirement that the TOE provide entropy sources as expected by VM-unaware guests. That is, the TOE
				does not have to anticipate every way a guest might try to acquire entropy as long as it supplies a
				mechanism that can be used by VM-aware guests, or provides access to a standard mechanism that a 
				VM-unaware guest would use.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            The ST author should select “Hypercall interface” if the TSF provides an API function through which 
				guest-resident software can obtain entropy or random numbers. The ST author should select 
				“virtual device interface” if the TSF presents a virtual device interface to the Guest OS through
				which it can obtain entropy or random numbers. Such an interface could present a virtualized real
				device, such as a TPM, that can be accessed by VM-unaware guests, or a virtualized fictional device
				that would require the Guest OS to be VM-aware. The ST author should select “passthrough access to 
				hardware entropy source” if the TSF permits Guest VMs to have direct access to hardware entropy or
				random number source on the platform. The ST author should select all items that are appropriate.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            For FCS_ENT_EXT.1.2, the VMM must ensure that the provision of entropy to one VM cannot affect the quality

                                The evaluator shall perform 15 trials for the RBG implementation. If the RBG is configurable, the

                                If the RBG has prediction resistance enabled, each trial consists of (1) instantiate drbg, (2)

				    next two are additional input and entropy input for the first call to generate. The final two are 
				    additional input and entropy input for the second call to generate. These values are randomly

                        <note role="application">RFC 4301 calls for an IPsec implementation to protect IP traffic through the use

				PROTECT the packet (e.g., encrypt the packet), BYPASS the IPsec services (e.g., no encryption), or
				DISCARD the packet (e.g., drop the packet). The SPD can be implemented in various ways, including 
				router access control lists, firewall rulesets, a “traditional” SPD, etc. Regardless of the 
				implementation details, there is a notion of a “rule” that a packet is “matched” against and a
				resulting action that takes place.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            While there must be a means to order the rules, a general approach to ordering is not mandated, as long

                                The evaluator shall examine the TSS and determine that it describes what takes 
                                place when a packet is processed by the TOE, e.g., the algorithm used to 
                                process the packet. The TSS describes how the SPD is implemented and the rules
                                for processing both inbound and outbound packets in terms of the IPsec policy. 
                                The TSS describes the rules that are available and the resulting actions 
                                available after matching a rule. The TSS describes how those rules and actions 
                                form the SPD in terms of the BYPASS (e.g., no encryption), DISCARD (e.g., drop the packet), and
                                PROTECT (e.g., encrypt the packet) actions defined in RFC 4301.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                As noted in section 4.4.1 of RFC 4301, the processing of entries in the SPD is non-trivial and 
                                the evaluator shall determine that the description in the TSS is sufficient to
                                determine which rules will be applied given the rule structure implemented by the 
                                TOE. For example, if the TOE allows specification of ranges, 
                                conditional rules, etc., the evaluator shall determine that the description of rule processing 
                                (for both inbound and outbound packets) is sufficient to determine the action that will be
                                applied, especially in the case where two different rules may apply. This description shall cover
                                both the initial packets (that is, no SA is established on the interface or for that particular 
                                packet) as well as packets that are part of an established SA.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>

                                The evaluator shall examine the operational guidance to verify it instructs the Administrator how 
                                to construct entries into the SPD that specify a rule for processing a packet. The description 
                                includes all three cases – a rule that ensures packets are encrypted/decrypted, dropped, and 
                                flow through the TOE without being encrypted. The evaluator shall determine 
                                that the description in the operational guidance is consistent with the description in the 
                                TSS, and that the level of detail in the operational guidance is sufficient to
                                allow the administrator to set up the SPD in an unambiguous fashion. This includes a discussion 
                                of how ordering of rules impacts the processing of an IP packet.
                            </Guidance>

					    by the rule - e.g., the IP addresses, TCP/UDP ports) in the packet header. The evaluator
					    performs both positive and negative test cases for each type of rule (e.g., a packet that
					    matches the rule and another that does not match the rule). The evaluator observes via the
					    audit trail, and packet captures that the TOE exhibited the expected
					    behavior: appropriate packets were dropped, allowed to flow without modification,

                                initiate a rekeying at the same time (which will result in redundant SAs). To reduce the

					    The evaluator shall configure the peer to present a different ID payload than the field in

                                physical resources, and how other Guest <abbr linkend="VM"/>s cannot access a physical resource
                                without being granted explicit access. For <abbr linkend="TOE"/>s that implement a robust

                                configure those resources for access by a Guest <abbr linkend="VM"/>. The evaluator shall
                                document in the evaluation report their analysis of why the controls offered to configure access
                                to physical resources can't be used to specify access to the resources identified in the second 
                                element (for example, if the interface offers a drop-down list of resources to assign, and the
                                denied resources are not included on that list, that would be sufficient justification in the

                                protocol transactions that take place, and what constitutes a “successful logon”. The evaluator
                                shall examine the operational guidance to determine that any necessary preparatory steps (e.g., 
                                establishing credential material such as pre-shared keys, tunnels, certificates, etc.) to logging
                                in are described. For each supported the login method, the evaluator shall ensure the operational
                                guidance provides clear instructions for successfully logging on. If configuration is necessary
                                to ensure the services provided before login are limited, the evaluator shall determine that the
                                operational guidance provides sufficient instruction on limiting the allowed services.

                            testing the mechanisms for reducing that attack surface by disabling Hypercalls, and ensuring that
                            Hypercall parameters are properly validated prior to use by the <abbr linkend="VMM"/>.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            A Hypercall interface allows a set of <abbr linkend="VMM"/> functions to be invoked by software running within a <abbr linkend="VM"/>. Hypercall interfaces are used by virtualization-aware <abbr linkend="VM"/>s to communicate and exchange data with the <abbr linkend="VMM"/>. For example, a <abbr linkend="VM"/> could use a hypercall interface to get information about the real world, such as the time of day or the underlying hardware of the host system. A hypercall could also be used to transfer data between <abbr linkend="VM"/>s through a copy-paste mechanism. Because hypercall interfaces expose the <abbr linkend="VMM"/> to Guest <abbr linkend="VM"/>s, these interfaces constitute attack surface. In order to minimize attack surface, these interfaces must be limited to the minimum needed to support <abbr linkend="VM"/> functionality.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>

                            For the assignment in FPT_HCL_EXT.1.3, the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author lists the interface functions that cannot be configured per FPT_HCL_EXT.1.2.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>

                            There is no expectation that the evaluator will need to review source code in order to accomplish the
                            Assurance Activity.  The evaluator documentation review should ensure that there are documented
                            Hypercall functions in the <abbr linkend="TSS"/>, that each documented Hypercall function contains the specified
                            information, and that there are not obvious or publicly known Hypercall functions missing.

                            If certificates are used by the update verification mechanism, certificates are validated in accordance with FIA_X509_EXT.1 and should be selected in FIA_X509_EXT.2.1. Additionally, FPT_TUD_EXT.2 must be included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            “Update” in the context of this SFR refers to the process of replacing a non-volatile, system resident software component with another. The former is referred to as the NV image, and the latter is the update image. While the update image is typically newer than the NV image, this is not a requirement. There are legitimate cases where the system owner may want to rollback a component to an older version (e.g., when the component manufacturer releases a faulty update, or when the system relies on an undocumented feature no longer present in the update). Likewise, the owner may want to update with the same version as the NV image to recover from faulty storage.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            All discrete software components (e.g., applications, drivers, kernel, firmware) of the <abbr linkend="TSF"/>, should be digitally signed by the corresponding manufacturer and subsequently verified by the mechanism performing the update. Since it is recognized that components may be signed by different manufacturers, it is essential that the update process verify that both the update and NV images were produced by the same manufacturer (e.g., by comparing public keys) or signed by legitimate signing keys (e.g., successful verification of certificates when using X.509 certificates).<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            The Digital Signature option is the preferred mechanism for authenticating updates. The Published Hash option will be removed from a future version of this PP.

                            At a minimum, the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> should enforce the following:<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            <h:ol type="a">
                                <h:li>On the x86 platform, a virtual System Management Interrupt (SMI) cannot invoke platform System Management Mode (SMM)</h:li>
                                <h:li>An attempt to update virtual firmware or virtual BIOS cannot cause physical platform firmware or physical platform BIOS to be modified</h:li>
                                <h:li>An attempt to update virtual firmware or virtual BIOS cannot cause the <abbr linkend="VMM"/> to be modified</h:li>
                            </h:ol>
                            Of the above, (a) does not apply to platforms that do not support SMM. The rationale behind activity (c) is that a firmware update of a single <abbr linkend="VM"/> must not affect other <abbr linkend="VM"/>s. So if multiple <abbr linkend="VM"/>s share the same firmware image as part of a common hardware abstraction, then the update of a single machine’s BIOS must not be allowed to change the common abstraction. The virtual hardware abstraction is part of the <abbr linkend="VMM"/>.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            This is an attestation requirement. The vendor must attest that software running in a <abbr linkend="VM"/> is not able to degrade or disrupt the functioning of other <abbr linkend="VM"/>s, the <abbr linkend="VMM"/>, or the Platform.

                            A measured launch of the platform and Virtualization System, demonstrates that the proper <abbr linkend="TOE"/> software was loaded. A measured launch process employs verifiable integrity measurement mechanisms. For example, a VS may hash components such as: the hypervisor, service <abbr linkend="VM"/>s and/or the Management Subsystem. A measured launch process only allows components to be executed after the measurement has been recorded. An example process may add each component’s hash before it is executed so that the final hash reflects the evidence of a component’s state prior to execution. The measurement may be verified as the system boots, but this is not required.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            The Platform is outside of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. However, this requirement specifies that the VS must be capable of receiving Platform measurements if the Platform provides them. This requirement is requiring <abbr linkend="TOE"/> support for Platform measurements if provided; it is not placing a requirement on the Platform to take such measurements.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            If available, hardware should be used to store measurements in such a manner that they cannot be modified in any manner except to be extended. These measurements should be produced in a repeatable manner so that a third party can verify the measurements if given the inputs. Hardware devices, like Trusted Platform Modules (TPM), TrustZone, and MMU are some examples that may serve as foundations for storing and reporting measurements.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            Platforms with a root of trust for measurement (RTM) should initiate the measured launch process. This may include core BIOS or the chipset. The chipset is the preferred RTM, but core BIOS or other firmware is acceptable. In system without a traditional RTM, the first component that boots would be considered the RTM, this is not preferred.

            The Security Objectives for the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> in Section 4 were constructed to address threats identified in Section 3.1. The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in Section 5.1 are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
            This section lists the set of Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) from Part 3 of the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Version 3.1, Revision 4 that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual assurance activities to be performed are specified in both Section 5.1 as well as in this section.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
            After the <abbr linkend="ST"/> has been approved for evaluation, the Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility (ITSEF) will obtain the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the <abbr linkend="CEM"/> for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the assurance activities contained within Section 5, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other <abbr linkend="CEM"/> assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. The assurance activities that are captured in Section 5 also provide clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is compliant with the PP.

                At the assurance level specified for <abbr linkend="TOE"/>s conformant to this PP, life-cycle support is limited to an examination of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> vendor’s development and configuration management process in order to provide a baseline level of assurance that the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> itself is developed in a secure manner and that the developer has a well-defined process in place to deliver updates to mitigate known security flaws. This is a result of the critical role that a developer’s practices play in contributing to the overall trustworthiness of a product.

                                The evaluator shall prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing aspects of the system.
				    While it is not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
				    evaluators must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in the 
				    ST is covered.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The Test Plan identifies the platforms to be tested, and for those platforms not included in the test
				    plan but included in the ST, the test plan provides a justification for not
				    testing the platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested platforms
				    and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not affect the testing to
				    be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the differences have no affect; rationale
				    must be provided. If all platforms claimed in the ST are tested, then no 
				    rationale is necessary.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The test plan describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is necessary
				    beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that the evaluators are
				    expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup of each platform either as
				    part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This may include special test drivers or
				    tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not just an assertion) is provided that the driver or 
				    tool will not adversely affect the performance of the functionality by the TOE and its platform.
				    This also includes the configuration of cryptographic engines to be used. The cryptographic 
				    algorithms implemented by these engines are those specified by this PP and used by the 
				    cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS/HTTPS, SSH).<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The test plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be followed to 
				    achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. The test report (which could
				    just be an annotated version of the test plan) details the activities that took place when the
				    test procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the tests. This shall be a 
				    cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and
				    then a successful re-run of the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the
				    supporting details), and not just the “pass” result.

For each vulnerability found, the evaluator either provides a rationale with respect to its non-applicability or the evaluator formulates a test (using the guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm the vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack vector needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. For example, if the vulnerability can be detected by pressing a key combination on boot-up, a test would be suitable at the assurance level of this PP.

        <section id="design" title="Design Description">
            Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the interaction of all entropy source components. It will describe the operation of the entropy source to include how it works, how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source design indicating where the random comes from, where it is passed next, any post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
            This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate.
        </section>
        <section id="justification" title="Entropy Justification">
            There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy source exhibiting probabilistic behavior (an explanation of the probability distribution and justification for that distribution given the particular source is one way to describe this). This argument will include a description of the expected entropy rate and explain how you ensure that sufficient entropy is going into the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with entropy.
        </section>

    <!-- Annex E: Equivalency Cuidelines -->
    <appendix id="equiv" title="Equivalency Guidlines">
        <section id="vm-intro" title="Introduction">
          The purpose of equivalence in PP-based evaluations is to find a balance between evaluation rigor and commercial
            practicability--to ensure that evaluations meet customer expectations while recognizing that there is little to be gained
            from requiring that every variation in a product or platform be fully tested. If a product is found to be compliant with
            a PP on one platform, then all equivalent products on equivalent platforms are also considered to be compliant with the PP.
        <h:br />
        <h:br />
        A Vendor can make a claim of equivalence if the Vendor believes that a particular instance of their Product implements
            PP-specified security functionality in a way equivalent to the implementation of the same functionality on another
            instance of their Product on which the functionality was tested. The Product instances can differ in version number or
            feature level (model), or the instances may run on different platforms. Equivalency can be used to reduce the testing
            required across claimed evaluated configurations. It can also be used during Assurance Maintenance to reduce testing
            needed to add more evaluated configurations to a certification.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      These equivalency guidelines do not replace Assurance Maintenance requirements or NIAP Policy #5 requirements for CAVP
            certificates. Nor may equivalency be used to leverage evaluations with expired certifications.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      This document provides guidance for determining whether Products and Platforms are equivalent for purposes of
            evaluation against the Protection Profile for Virtualization (VPP) when instantiated with either the Client or Server
            Extended Package.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      Equivalence has two aspects:
      <h:br />
      <h:ol>
        <h:li><h:b><h:i>Product Equivalence:</h:i></h:b> Products may be considered equivalent if there are no
          differences between Product Models and Product Versions with respect to PP-specified security functionality.</h:li>
        <h:li><h:b><h:i>Platform Equivalence:</h:i></h:b> Platforms may be considered equivalent if there are no
          significant differences in the services they provide to the Product--or in the way the platforms
          provide those services--with respect to PP-specified security functionality.</h:li>
      </h:ol>
      The equivalency determination is made in accordance with these guidelines by the Validator and Scheme using information
            provided by the Evaluator/Vendor.
    </section>
    <section id="approach" title="Approach to Equivalency Analysis">
      There are two scenarios for performing equivalency analysis. One is when a product has been certified and the vendor
      wants to show that a later product should be considered certified due to equivalence with the earlier product. The
      other is when multiple product variants are going though evaluation together and the vendor would like to reduce
      the amount of testing that must be done. The basic rules for determining equivalence are the same in both cases.
      But there is one additional consideration that applies to equivalence with previously certified products. That is,
      the product with which equivalence is being claimed must have a valid certification in accordance with scheme rules
      and the Assurance Maintenance process must be followed. If a product’s certification has expired, then equivalence
      cannot be claimed with that product.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      When performing equivalency analysis, the Evaluator/Vendor should first use the factors and guidelines for Product
      Model equivalence to determine the set of Product Models to be evaluated. In general, Product Models that do not differ
      in PP-specified security functionality are considered equivalent for purposes of evaluation against the VPP.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      If multiple revision levels of Product Models are to be evaluated--or to determine whether a revision of an evaluated
      product needs re-evaluation--the Evaluator/Vendor and Validator should use the factors and guidelines for Product
      Version equivalence to determine whether Product Versions are equivalent.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      Having determined the set of Product Models and Versions to be evaluated, the next step is to determine the set of
      Platforms that the Products must be tested on.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      Each non-equivalent Product for which compliance is claimed must be fully tested on each non-equivalent platform
      for which compliance is claimed. For non-equivalent Products on equivalent platforms, only the differences that
      affect PP-specified security functionality must be tested for each product.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      If the set of equivalent Products includes only bare-metal installations, then the equivalency analysis is complete.
        But if any members of the set include hosted installations or installations that integrate with an existing host operating
        system or control domain, then software platform equivalence must be taken into consideration. The Evaluator/Vendor and
        Validator should use the factors and guidance for software platform equivalence to determine whether different models or
        versions of host or control domain operating systems require separate testing.
      <h:b><h:i>“Differences in PP-Specified Security Functionality” Defined</h:i></h:b>
      <h:br />
      If PP-specified security functionality is implemented by the TOE, then differences in the actual implementation
      between versions or product models break equivalence for that feature. Likewise, if the TOE implements the
      functionality in one version or model and the functionality is implemented by the platform in another version
      or model, then equivalence is broken. If the functionality is implemented by the platform in multiple models or
      versions on equivalent platforms, then the functionality is considered different if the product invokes the platform
      differently to perform the function.
    </section>
    <section id="modelequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Product Model Equivalence">
      Product Model equivalence attempts to determine whether different feature levels of the same product across
      a product line are equivalent for purposes of PP testing. For example, if a product has a “basic” edition and an “enterprise”
      edition, is it necessary to test both models? Or does testing one model provide sufficient assurance that both models
      are compliant?

    <section id="platformequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Platform Equivalence">
      Platform equivalence is used to determine the platforms that a product must be tested on. These guidelines are divided
        into sections for determining hardware equivalence and software (host OS/control domain) equivalence. If the Product is
        installed onto bare metal, then only hardware equivalence is relevant. If the Product is installed onto an OS—or is integrated
        into an OS—then both hardware and software equivalence are required. Likewise, if the Product can be installed either on bare
        metal or on an operating system, both hardware and software equivalence are relevant.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      <subsection id="hardware-equiv" title="Hardware Platform Equivalence">
        If a Virtualization Solution runs directly on hardware without an operating system, then platform equivalence is based primarily
          on processor architecture and instruction sets.
        <h:br /><h:br />
        Platforms with different processor architectures and instruction sets are not equivalent. This is probably
          not an issue because there is likely to be a different product model for different hardware environments.
        <h:br /><h:br />
        Equivalency analysis becomes important when comparing platforms with the same processor architecture. Processors
          with the same architecture that have instruction sets that are subsets or supersets of each other are not disqualified
          from being equivalent for purposes of a VPP evaluation. If the VS takes the same code paths when executing PP-specified
          security functionality on different processors of the same family, then the processors can be considered equivalent with
          respect to that application.
        <h:br /><h:br />
        For example, if a VS follows one code path on platforms that support the AES-NI instruction and another on platforms that do
          not, then those two platforms are not equivalent with respect to that VS functionality. But if the VS follows the same code
          path whether or not the platform supports AES-NI, then the platforms are equivalent with respect to that functionality.
        <h:br /><h:br />
        The platforms are equivalent with respect to the VS if the platforms are equivalent with respect to all PP-specified
        security functionality.

        <h:br />
        The guidance for Product Model (Section 3) specifies that Products intended for use on substantially different operating
          systems (e.g. Windows vs. Linux vs. SunOS) are different Models. Therefore, platforms running substantially different
          operating systems are de facto not equivalent. Likewise, operating systems with different major version numbers are not
          equivalent for purposes of this PP.

          As a result, Software Platform equivalence is largely concerned with revisions and variations of operating systems that
