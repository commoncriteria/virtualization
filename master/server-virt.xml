     	<!-- 1.1 Overview -->
    
	<section id="overview" title="Overview">
          The scope of this PP-Module is to define the security functionality of a Server Virtualization product in
          terms of [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP-Module is not 
          complete in itself, but rather is intended for use with the following Base-PP:
	      
	      <h:ul>
		      <h:li>Protection Profile for Virtualization, Version 2.0, DD MMM 202Y.<comment> TBD</comment></h:li>
	      </h:ul>

	  This Base-PP is valid because Server Virtualization is a specific type of Virtualization System and is expected to
          implement security functionality that is not common to all Virtualization Systems. One additional SFR
          has been defined in this PP-Module to define security functionality that is unique to this
          particular type of Virtualization System.

          do not include administration of software running within Guest VMs, such as the Guest OS. Administrators need

          communities of interest or coalitions. In the context of a VS, information domains are generally implemented
          as collections of VMs connected by virtual networks. The VS itself can be considered an Information Domain,

	<!-- 1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation -->
      <section id="targets" title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation">
        Server Virtualization, for the purposes of this Module, refers to a virtualization system that implements 
        virtualized hardware components on server-class hardware. It creates a virtualized hardware environment for 
        each instance of an operating system (virtual machines or VMs) permitting these environments to execute
        concurrently while maintaining isolation and the appearance of exclusive control over assigned computing
        resources. Each VM instance supports applications such as file servers, web servers, and mail servers. Server
        virtualization may also support client operating systems in a virtual desktop or thin-client environment.
        Typically, virtualized servers provide services to remote clients from a data center, and are generally not
	directly accessible by non-administrative users.<h:br/><h:br/>
	A TOE that claims conformance with this PP-Module must also claim conformance to the Protection Profile 
	for Virtualization. And a TOE that claims conformance with the Protection Profile for Virtualization
	must also claim conformance either to this Module or to the PP-Module for Client Virtualization.

	The TOE does not require any additional supplementary information to describe its entropy sources
	beyond the requirements outlined in the ‘Entropy Documentation and Assessment’ section of the Base
	Virtualization PP. As with other Base-PP requirements, the only additional requirement is that the
	entropy documentation also applies to the specific Server Virtualization capabilities of the TOE in
	addition to the functionality required by the Base-PP.
